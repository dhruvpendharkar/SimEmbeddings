# SimEmbeddings
Developing novel fine-tuning method utilizing cosine similarity based loss for token embeddings to improve model interpretability

## Current Progress:

Working on establishing baseline performance by finetuning GPT-2 on COVID-19 Q/A data

## TODO:

Collect baselines
Create human preference dataset using webtool courtesy @aaditjuneja
Implement similarity based finetuning and run experiments
